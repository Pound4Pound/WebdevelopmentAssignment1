Assignment 7 started


-------------------

Table error fixed.

-------------------

Program development halted after assignment 6.  A compile error on the creation of the table was noted however the developer did not notice a problem as the page created the table, appended it to the register page and inserted the images and text. Developer thought he achieved the task.

Attempts to develop assignment 7 ran into problems as the code would not compile beyond the table. When attempting to develop the requirement for assignment 7 the web page would not respond and it was identified that the error from appending the table was the issue.  The developer has not been able to resolve the issue for the table.  The error lists:
_cannot read property 'appendchild' of null_. **error bypassed on 2019/01/27**

**error solution was to assign the DOM element and verify if it exists within the page.**
