Current status:

Assignment 8:

Added link anchor to images and pointed window to the webpage URL.

Unable to organize timer to close out window.


-------------------
Assignment 7 started. Able to create form and stack instruction messages to the right of the field and allow them to be hidden until the field is focused on.

Integrated error checking of form for Postal code. Was able to find a function on [stack overflow] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15774555/efficient-regex-for-canadian-postal-code-function) to check Regular expressions for Canadian post codes and American zip codes. However gathering the information from the field was difficult 
as the field would not hold a value when starting the home page.  This error still has not been resolved.

-------------------

Table error fixed.

-------------------

Program development halted after assignment 6.  A compile error on the creation of the table was noted however the developer did not notice a problem as the page created the table, appended it to the register page and inserted the images and text. Developer thought he achieved the task.

Attempts to develop assignment 7 ran into problems as the code would not compile beyond the table. When attempting to develop the requirement for assignment 7 the web page would not respond and it was identified that the error from appending the table was the issue.  The developer has not been able to resolve the issue for the table.  The error lists:
_cannot read property 'appendchild' of null_. **error bypassed on 2019/01/27**

**error solution was to assign the DOM element and verify if it exists within the page.**
